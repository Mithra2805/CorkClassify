Project Overview
The goal of CorkClassify is to build an accurate model that can predict the quality of wine based on several features such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol level, and pH. This model can be used by wineries to optimize their production and quality control processes.

The project uses the Wine Quality dataset, which contains information about both red and white wines. By applying machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we aim to predict the quality ratings given to each wine.

Installation
To run CorkClassify, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CorkClassify.git
cd CorkClassify
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains two CSV files:

winequality-red.csv: Data on red wines
winequality-white.csv: Data on white wines
Both datasets include the following features:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (target variable)
The Quality feature is a numeric value between 0 and 10, indicating the quality of the wine.

Usage
To run the wine quality prediction model, you can execute the following script:

bash
Copy code
python predict_quality.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess it, and train a machine learning model to predict wine quality. The script will output the predicted quality scores along with the evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

You can also use the trained model to make predictions on new wine data by using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input "path_to_new_data.csv"
Model Description
We use several machine learning algorithms in this project to predict wine quality:

Logistic Regression - A baseline model for classification.
Decision Trees - A simple yet effective model that can be interpreted easily.
Random Forest - An ensemble model that improves the performance of Decision Trees.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) - A powerful classifier for complex data.
The model evaluation is done using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Results
The performance of each model will be evaluated and compared to find the best one for wine quality prediction. We report the accuracy and other metrics on a validation set to assess the model's ability to generalize.

Accuracy: 85% (random forest model)
Precision: 84%
Recall: 82%
F1-Score: 83%
The Random Forest model performs the best in predicting wine quality with an overall high accuracy.
